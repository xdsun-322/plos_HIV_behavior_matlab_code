######The manual of generating the plots in the paper ######

"A multiscale model for HIV/AIDS infection with behavioral responses to risk perception" by Xiaodan Sun, Weike Zhou, Yanni Xiao (2022).

The matlab code is edited under MATLAB R2021a.

$"between host" document: code titled  "between_only_period" is used for generating figure 2, describing the dynamic behaviors of the between host model; for figure 1, 3 and 4, you can modify the parameters of the "between_only_period.m" to generate corresponding plots; code titled "between_only_period_amplitude" is used for generating figure 5.

$"between and within host" document: code titled  "within_between_effectofa_period" is used for generating figure 6, describing dynamic behaviors of the multiscale model; for figure 7 and 9, you can modify the parameters of the "within_between_effectofa_period.m" to generate corresponding plots; code titled "compare_a_oscillate" is used for generating figure 8.

$"controal measure" document: code titled "adherence_effect_fig13" is used for generating figure 13, studying of the effect of the control measures; for figure 10, 11 and 12, you can generate the corresponding plots similarly. 


@Remark: Feel free to contant me if you have any probles when running the codes.
