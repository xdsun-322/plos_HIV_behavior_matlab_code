######The manual of calculating travel fluxes in epidemic areas ######

"Determining travel fluxes in epidemic areas" by Daipeng Chen, Yuyi Xue, Yanni Xiao (2021).

The matlab code is edited under MATLAB R2021a.

$"Data" document: It includes four datasets. 1. The New_cases is daily reported COVID-19 cases in all citites. 2. The Population_flow is the estimated mobility network among the cities using the gravity model (17). We recommend replacing it with real data if available. 3. The Growth_rate is the estimated value of parameters in formula (6) which gives the value of growth rate. 4. The Diffusion_distance is the calculation result of the code in "Diffusion_distance" document.

$"Diffusion_distance" document: There is only one code used to calculate the diffusion distance among cities.

$"Time_location" document: There is one main function to solve the zero-one programming (9). Other function files are used to generate the growth rate and COVID-19 cases.

$"Travel_flux" document: The files in this document are mainly used to calculate the potential in each city and the travel flux among these cities.

$"Testable_prediction" document: The files in this document are used to perform the prediction under different movement pattern.

@Remark: After downloading the code, please modify the input file path (C:\Users\Daipeng1993\Desktop\Code\Data) to your own storage path. Some functions in different documents are common.
